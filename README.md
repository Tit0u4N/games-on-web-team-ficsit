To ensure a smooth and organized development process, we follow these collaboration guidelines:

- **Branching Strategy**:
    - For each issue, create a new branch from the `dev` branch.
    - Name the branch in the following format: `feature/{issue-id}-{branch-name}`.

- **Pull Requests**:
    - All changes should be submitted through pull requests (PRs).
    - PRs are required to merge any code into the `dev` and `main` branches.
